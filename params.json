  "body": "All the functions used are pretty easy to understand except for the %9 part See that is used for separating the array into 9 different arrays which then makes our job faster and efficent\r\n\r\nWhy %9 instead of anything else you ask ?\r\n\r\nThat's because when do number%9 we get sum of all digits and then sum of all digits for that and so on until we get a single digit number\r\n\r\n18123%9 = 6\r\n1+8+1+2+3=15 => 1+5 =6\r\nSee what I am saying, except for 9 multiples and 0-9 we get 0 which is okay because that's unique\r\n\r\nWe seperate the array elements into 9 groups because modulo only returns 0-8 that makes them 9 groups\r\n\r\nRest of the code is self explainatory and feel free to email me at python.hithesh@gmail.com",
