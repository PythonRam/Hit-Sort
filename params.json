  "body": "We come across situations in real life where we may have to sort positive integers because that's how we count in real life, but when the count becomes big and basic sorts won't work we need something more than just comparing two numbers. This is sorting algorithm to make your job easier.\r\nAt 10,000 numbers in an array it takes less than 1/5th of a second to sort and his 12 times faster than regular basic sorts.\r\nWhen the numbers in the array get more and more it becomes harder and harder to solve with regular sorts, but this will sort the array in much smaller time. When tested with 10000000 numbers it did the job without throwing maximum depth error in a much faster time.\r\nI will make the same code in all the languages I'm familiar with  \r\n* Python(done)\r\n* C# (coming soon)\r\n* JAVA (coming soon)\r\n* php (coming soon)\r\n* JavaScript (coming soon)\r\n* C++ (coming soon)\r\n\r\n####All of the trick lies in dividing the numbers into groups finding the minimum value of each group and find minimum in group of minimums obtained\r\n\r\nRest of the code is self explanatory and feel free to email me at python.hithesh@gmail.com\r\nAuthor @PythonRam",
